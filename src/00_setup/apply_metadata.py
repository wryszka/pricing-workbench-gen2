# MAGIC # Apply Metadata — descriptions on everything
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One-shot, idempotent pass over the Pricing Workbench schema that sets:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Schema** comment
# MAGIC - **Volume** comments (`external_landing`, `saved_payloads`)
# MAGIC - **Table** comments for every table the app / pipeline references
# MAGIC - **Column** comments for the high-traffic tables (UPT, quotes, feature_catalog, mf_leaderboard)
# MAGIC - **Registered model** comments (UC) for the pricing + impact-study models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Safe to re-run — every statement is guarded. Missing tables are skipped
# MAGIC with a note, never break the run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Wired into `setup_demo` (runs at the end) and available on its own as the
# MAGIC `apply_metadata` bundle job.

# MAGIC ## 6. Grants — app service principal on UC models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Databricks App runs as a service principal, so the SP needs explicit
# MAGIC UC grants before `/deployment/champions/{family}/set` and
# MAGIC `/deployment/rollback` can swap `@champion` / `@previous_champion`
# MAGIC aliases. Grants are idempotent and safe to re-run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We grant `MANAGE` (required for alias operations on UC registered
# MAGIC models) alongside `ALL_PRIVILEGES` (covers EXECUTE + APPLY_TAG). No
# MAGIC ownership transfer is needed.

# COMMAND ----------

# The 4 production champion models — the app's /deployment/set + /rollback
# routes must be able to swap the `@champion` / `@previous_champion` aliases.
# On UC that requires the model's owner privilege, which we transfer to the
# app SP. Factory candidates and agent models stay owned by the user.
