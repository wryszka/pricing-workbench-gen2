# Databricks notebook source

# MAGIC # Inject vendor-data variation into raw tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Runs AFTER the silver build completes — mutates the `raw_*` tables to
# MAGIC simulate fresh vendor data that's drifted from the previously-approved
# MAGIC silver snapshot. This is what gives the Data Ingestion UI a real
# MAGIC diff + impact to display: silver represents the last-approved state,
# MAGIC raw represents the new (un-reviewed) update.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Deterministic per-key — re-runs produce the same mutations so demo
# MAGIC behaviour is stable. Idempotent — running twice is the same as once
# MAGIC because mutations are computed from the SOURCE silver values.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Mutations applied:
# MAGIC  * **raw_geospatial_hazard_enrichment** — ~30% of postcodes get a
# MAGIC    risk uplift (flood +1 zone, crime +20%, subsidence +1)
# MAGIC  * **raw_credit_bureau_summary** — ~10% of policies get a credit
# MAGIC    score drift (±50 points) and ±1 CCJ
# MAGIC  * **raw_market_pricing_benchmark** — ~30% of SIC+region keys get a
# MAGIC    market median rate uplift (+8%)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Tweak the WHERE clauses below if you want to change which fraction
# MAGIC of rows is affected — the demo narrative looks crispest with 20-40%.
