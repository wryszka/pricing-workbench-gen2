"""Agentic-distribution tool layer — the carrier's *services*, not its raw data.

This module is the single definition of what an outside agent can do with the
motor pricing engine. Both surfaces sit on top of it:

  server/routes/mcp.py    JSON-RPC MCP server (external agents, Claude Desktop)
  server/routes/broker.py conversational quote page (Claude drives these tools)

Design rule: the LLM never invents a premium. Every price returned here comes
from the `pwg2_motor_scorer` Model Serving endpoint — the same route-optimized
endpoint the Live Pricing System and the load tester hit. The engine is
data-in / price-out; these tools only decide *what data* goes in.

The feature contract has three tiers:

  ASKED      what a real quote journey asks the customer (15 fields)
  DERIVED    computed from the asked answers (no customer input)
  BOOK_MEAN  genuinely unknowable for a new customer — telematics and
             behaviour history. A new customer has no driving record with us,
             so these start at the book mean and only tighten once real
             telematics arrive. Radar Live behaves the same way.

That last tier is a talking point, not a fudge: `price_motor_risk` reports which
inputs were customer-supplied and which fell back to book mean, so the
provenance of every number is visible in the response.
