# MAGIC
# MAGIC `databricks-feature-engineering` logs models into UC but doesn't set the
# MAGIC registered-model `comment` (description) field that Catalog Explorer
# MAGIC surfaces. This notebook patches each motor model with a clear
# MAGIC description of what it does, what features it uses, and what target
# MAGIC it predicts. Idempotent — re-runs overwrite the description.
