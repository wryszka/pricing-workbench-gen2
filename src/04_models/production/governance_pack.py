# MAGIC
# MAGIC Produces a comprehensive, sign-off-ready PDF for a single UC-registered
# MAGIC model version. Designed to answer every question a CDO, CRO, CFO or Chief
# MAGIC Actuary would ask at a validation committee:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC  1. What is this model and what does it do?
# MAGIC  2. Who trained it, when, from what data?
# MAGIC  3. How well does it perform?
# MAGIC  4. Which features drive it and do they make business sense?
# MAGIC  5. How stable has it been across prior versions?
# MAGIC  6. What are the known risks and limitations?
# MAGIC  7. Where does regulatory / compliance responsibility sit?
# MAGIC  8. Who signed it off?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Output:
# MAGIC  - PDF uploaded to `/Volumes/{catalog}/{schema}/governance_packs/`
# MAGIC  - Row in `{catalog}.{schema}.governance_packs_index`
# MAGIC  - Audit event `governance_pack_generated`
